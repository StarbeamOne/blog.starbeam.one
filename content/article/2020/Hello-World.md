Hello world!  

I am excited to announce my efforts here with The Starbeam Project.  Although, in my life I have found that it is [best not to mention intention and plans](https://thecreative.cafe/if-you-want-to-make-god-laugh-tell-him-your-plans-413ee471c7b7) but to actually put forth the effort.

If all goes well, this project will represent the next phase and major chapter in my life.  I am pretty pumped about this vision and plan to spend the next several years developing it in one form or another.

This project actually started out back in 2018 when [I assembled all my art together](https://ossem.com/) while going through a tremendous creative phase.  It required a great deal of energy to accomplish, but I am glad I did it.  There's something quite satisfying to saying "this is my art" and having a central place to visit it when desired, or to share it if one is so daring.

The Starbeam Project takes this desire and effort to the next natural progression.  For the first time in my life, I feel that I have a startup project idea with a legitimate, viable business model.  It is also an intersection of three core passions in my life:

- Technology
- Art (drawing and writing)
- Business

I like to keep details to a minimum as I have found that oversharing leads to self-sabotage.  Let's just say that at the moment this is all I think about and it has become an obsession, with new visions on the daily.

Until a launch is made, I am not sure how often I will be able to update this blog.  After all, if I am blogging, I am not coding. ðŸ˜Š

I have created [a registration page](https://register.starbeam.one/) for those who would like to sign up for updates, along with all the necessary (and maybe not-so-necessary ðŸ˜†) social media accounts to establish presence.  While I do not have the application-specific code available as open source, I am indeed still [utilizing my framework](https://github.com/DragonSpark/Framework) and you can follow along with any updates found in a [project-specific branch here](https://github.com/DragonSpark/Framework/tree/projects/Starbeam).

Thank you for any support, interest, and good tidings you may provide.  See you out there. ðŸŽ‰
