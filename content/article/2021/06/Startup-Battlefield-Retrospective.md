Some time has passed since I got myself riled up and did a very brash thing with the [Startup Battlefield 2021 Application](/2021/05/startup-battlefield-2021-application/).  I wanted to put some thoughts here around it as I have found writing helps get me out of my design/development funk.  Not that I am in a funk right now, but I'd like things to be a bit crisper than they are.

So my feelings on the entire ordeal are a bit conflicted.  On one hand, I "got out of my shell" so to speak and got myself out there.  I also posted a bunch of content here on this blog, which is always a plus.  Assembling all of that took guts and I am kind of proud of myself for doing that.

On the other hand, I considered that a tremendous waste of time and completely unnecessary. üòÖ  Especially when you consider that my current schedule doesn't even have me in [public beta until August of next year](/2021/06/june-2021-status-update/).

The fear occurs to me that I exposed all of my ideas and give competition a foothold.  The other side tells me to get over myself and competition is going to happen anyways.  Besides, the information I emitted barely touches the surface of what I have been building.

However, all stated, I probably would not do that again.  It took me actually doing it, to land on that judgement.  So I suppose, all-in-all, it's a tie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
