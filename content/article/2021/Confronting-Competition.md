It's been a tough week here.  What compounds it is that I was really on a roll there, ahead of schedule and cooking with momentum.  That all seems like ancient history right now, so I guess I am spending some of my time here "getting my house in order."

First, Twitter is such a distraction.  A double-edged sword, really.  I use it to find out the latest news, but then I find out about all the sites out there that could be considered "my competition."

Although I haven't found something 100% like what I have in mind, it causes pause for concern.  The last thing I want to do is to add yet another site out there that adds to the noise.

But yesterday I found out yet another site, and it was the best/closest yet.  25k followers on Twitter.

It actually got to the point of "well, since there are so many, why not just use what's out there already instead?"  And then I realized, they don't do exactly what I am looking to do, and that is why I am building mine.

So, I guess I still have some value proposition in my vision.  That is what I keep clinging to, because it's tough.  It's tough having to actively develop software when all these other "similar" and actively deployed solutions have users celebrating their use.  *Super* tough!

With that in mind, I have to put on the blinders, and have removed Twitter from my daily grind.  It's nice to learn about stuff, but when it dampens morale and momentum, it becomes a liability.

Especially when I am so close to an MVP.  Looks like a few more months now.  Gotta keep it chuggin' y'all.
