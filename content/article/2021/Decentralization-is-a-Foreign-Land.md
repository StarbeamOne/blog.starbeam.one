Continuing my spontaneous series here. üòÅ

I have been studying the decentralized space since late June 2017, so nearly four years now.  If I was attending college then you could say that I am a graduate in such matters (assuming I acquired all my credits, something I failed to do in real live BUT I DIGRESS).

There's a certain quality or metric that has seemed elusive to decentralization during that time, and that is adoption.

What's interesting is that it seems that it *is* being adopted, but to me it seems that *mass* (or viral) adoption is not taking place.

Why?

Well, in my estimation, the decentralized mindset is so foreign.  It is completely different to how you typically approach societal life that it takes a considerable adjustment -- much like visiting a foreign country:

- Lost your seed words/password/keys?  Tough luck. You've now lost access to the entire value of the wallet that stores it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Got scammed out of your entire wallet value?  "Should have done your research ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" (common refrain from crypto apologists).
- [Got tortured with a drill until you gave up your keys](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-robbery-torture-cryptocurrency-netherlands-a8807986.html)?  Well, should have known what "[being your own bank](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/be-your-own-bank-with-bitcoin/)" really means. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

These sorts of barriers are difficult to adjust to and are not for everyone (especially with the prominently cynical & critical attitude from the crypto community but that's another topic altogether).  This might explain why artists can get their friends and family to onboard onto the NFT hype (adoption) but struggle getting *their friends' friends and family* to onboard (mass adoption).

While decentralization promotes self-responsibility and individual sovereignty, what it fails to account for is a very basic human truth, particularly in peace time: *people are lazy*.

Services that account for this laziness and meet them there are the ones that meet the most success.  Look no further than Coinbase.  A company that takes a complicated, foreign matter and makes it familiar in a centralized way.  It was [valued at $100 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/04/13/coinbase-is-not-worth-100b-and-its-stock-could-double-on-its-ipo/?sh=10c86c13461c) when opening to the market.  Sure, Coinbase is loathed by crypto "Not your keys not your crypto" purists.  But do Coinbase users care?

Again, *people are lazy* and want others to do the work for them.  (Behold, the free market!)  So what if it's not their keys?  They have forked over their private information in adherence to KYC  and AML laws.  Most are there to get rich (quick) anyways, and because they are pegged with all their private information, the government will sure to be knocking when it's tax time.

See?  Everyone wins, lazy and government alike.

That is why we have a free market after all: to enable an efficient environment where you can create a service that improves the lives of those that use it.

All this to say that what starbeam.one offers is a vision that operates much like Coinbase: make a difficult foreign land more familiar and accessible.  Whereas Coinbase specializes in trading and currencies, starbeam.one is their "NFT equivalent" (however it is our view that [they are digital licenses, not NFTs](/2021/05/the-opportunity-as-i-see-it/).).

Currently, with the NFT space users are forced into a foreign land and if they run into problems, well, better luck next time.  This is completely different from what they *expect*: **recourse for when things go wrong**.  Remember, people are lazy, so when things go wrong they want someone to fix it for them -- "*right freaking now!*"

With a centralized system, this is a piece of cake.  We simply reverse the transaction and everything was as before (assuming appropriate and authorized controls, of course).  Here, we allow users to utilize a familiar system, get comfortable with it, *then* offer them the means to off-ramp into their foreign land once they deemed fit and are comfortable with assuming the risk of drill saw torture and other perils.

This gives the user choice and flexibility, something that simply doesn't exist in the current market, making a foreign land a little less foreign. ‚úå
