Well, another checkin so it must mean I am stuck somewhere again. üòÅ  Indeed, another bout of "The Analysis" has struck, so I am left staring at the ceiling for hours at a time, awaiting the inspiration to save me.

There's also Twitter, which I find myself switching to uncontrollably to find the latest news -- whatever it may be.

I am getting close, however.  This is the last task involving "new" analysis, and this is one of three tasks (or stories) remaining.  After that, I am finished with structural tasks, then it's a matter of fleshing out what I have built and making it presentable.

All the while, what I struggle with now (speaking of Twitter) is watching the space I am wanting to step my toe in and watch it evolve.  It's tough!  Seeing people celebrate their victories of existing product when I struggle to even get a model together, let alone compile.

Today I learned that the product that I consider closest to what I aim to build received $1.75M funding round.  Jelly.  Talk about a distraction.  If I was smart I would pull a Facebook on Twitter and nuke it all completely.  Yeah... about that "smart" business. üòÖ

I continue to tell myself that what I have in mind is a bit different (dare I say "beyond"?) what is currently in market.  In fact, I would dare say the next logical step.  Gotta keep that morale up. 

Anyways, I hope to share it soon. ‚úå
