Happy New Year... ish. üòÅ  I am having a little down time -- a case of the January's as it were -- so I decided to check in here with a little update.

Things are actually running at a pretty good clip here.  In fact, I hesitate to mention it but I am in a bit of a groove as of late, pretty much writing solutions and supporting code at will.  I have been *mostly* able to accurately gauge project management requirements and am pretty much on schedule.

Currently, it appears I should be structurally complete by April.  Then another few months after that -- tentatively circling August -- I will be feature complete and *should* finally be able to freely discuss what the heck I am working on.

January 13th marked a full year since I declared my intentions of working on this vision.  Otherwise known as my first commit in Azure DevOps.  Happy Belated Birthday-ish.

Anyways, don't want to get too tied up here but did want to check in.  Hopefully a few more of these and we'll move onto more interesting tidbits.  Until next time. ‚úå
