Goodness, what a run.  I have basically been on a development tear since the last check-in, clocking about 10-12 hours a day.  I guess that's my typical schedule, but all of it has been totally dedicated to disciplined development, which is the ideal.

So upon last check-in [I believe I was spilling about having some videos done](https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/03/march-2021-status-update/) by now, which WAS ALL A LIE. ðŸ˜…  Shows you for taking the time to believe me.  I'm still going to do those videos (I promise!), but I had to get some features done, first.  It would be highly embarrassing to brag about all these features I have built when some rather important ones were not provably/demonstrably finished, no?

I have gotten so much finished, however, and feel like I am getting to some semblance of "close."  Really there are two features left: one that is critical to commerce (withdrawals), and the other one fleshes out a proprietary feature that sort of glues the whole "magic" of this application together.

Based on my super amazing product management software (read: Excel spreadsheet ðŸ˜›), I should have these done by end of this month.  Then, it should be the whole or most of June learning about vlogging and putting together a nice little tour of what I have built.  Finally.

Currently, July looks like a break month.  It will have been over 18 months of this, with these past 6-7 being especially intense and productive with consistent 70-80 hour weeks.  A breather is in order, especially once I have some videos I can use to show others what's up.  Then August it begins once again.

Nifty note: [Lana Del Rey recently announced an album recently for July](https://pitchfork.com/news/lana-del-rey-announces-new-album-blue-banisters/).  That's a two-month advance notice.  I am thinking of doing the same: August announcement for an October release.

Nifty note x2: [October 12, 2021 does mark the end of support for Silverlight](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788)...
