I guess now that I have spent the past week preparing for the [Startup Battlefield 2021 Application](https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/05/startup-battlefield-2021-application/) (seriously, it took a lot!), I am more in the writing mood and can start putting together some additional thoughts around what I have been working on and the field I am entering here with starbeam.one.

Recently I have been assessing risks.  Of course, the biggest risk with any company is that it could fail.  And companies, especially startups ***gulp*** fail all the time.

This is particularly tricky with starbeam.one, or any company that does what I am doing (centralized digital ownership), as if it goes away, then all the licenses that fall under its provenance also go away as well.  This means no more sales or resales.

This is two failures in one.

Of course, this is a huge value proposition with decentralization: companies can fail and/or go away but the digital products they sale are enshrined/memorialized on a decentralized network that survives as long as at least one node across the world remains online and synchronizes its database.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for this one at the moment.  First, it would have to seriously concede that what I am working on could fail.  For any self-respecting entrepreneur that's a tough task to undertake.  Secondly, I do have some answers and while I am not happy with them at the moment I will share them in the spirit of perhaps improving them by examination (sort of the exercise with this post).

The most obvious to me is that at some point I would like to believe that if worse came to worst, I would at least build an off ramp to at least one blockchain for product enshrinement.  This makes the most sense to me.  There's no way I am going to put so much effort into this only to allow it to die without people enjoying their product if it goes away.  The investors that I bring aboard must have an understanding of this as well.

The other consideration is perhaps creating a new product/system that allows products to live on after the system has passed.  Something that is a little different from the blockchain.  A new file format, perhaps?  This is a new product idea of course and I am already maxed out with the existing one I am currently fleshing out.  So, let's put that on the backburner for now.

In any case, this is the one area that I fully concede the blockchain has the upper hand.  But, since it only has it when the worst has already happened to my company, does it really?

What's important is that this threat is not only properly identified, but finding investors that also understand this risk and account for this accordingly.  We have to ensure that the products sold are properly enshrined somehow in the event of the catastrophic (and in my case, unthinkable).

Ironically, doing so only furthers confidence in the system, which should improve adoption, which makes it less likely that we will have to lean on such a plan. âœŒ
