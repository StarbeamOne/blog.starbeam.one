### What Now?!

WOW... today is the day, and I am beside myself to finally be here and make this announcement.  Today marks the result of over two years of development on a single goal, having started in October 2019: to create a centralized marketplace where users can sell and resell digital ownership in the form of digital licenses.

### What the Heck is this thing?!

[starbeam.one](https://alpha.starbeam.one) is a Digital Publishing Starshipâ„¢ that allows you to purchase and resell digital licenses produced by artists on a provided primary and secondary markets, respectively.

### How Do I See It?

[You can visit it here!](https://alpha.starbeam.one)

### Do You Have Any Further Information/FAQ?

You can get more information in [our about section here](https://alpha.starbeam.one/about).

### Do You Have Videos?

Yep, as a matter of fact, I sure do.

I have spent the past three weeks attempting to collect my thoughts into a video/blogging format.  I originally estimated 3-4 days for this task, and I just finished this morning. ðŸ˜…

To start, you can find the Introduction Sessions here (these are more conceptual, going into my mindset on how I view this space -- and get to meet/know me as well!):

Note that all QR codes are listed in the comments of these videos on YouTube in the case that you cannot scan them.

Next, we have the Product Tour, or a very minimal version of it, getting enough of the features here just to get by and start out using the system (hopefully):

I hope you enjoy these videos.  I have learned *a lot* about the process of filming and post-production in the past few weeks, as you can imagine!

So a little retrospective here: I feel it took about two weeks to find my "voice" in front of the camera.  I still have footage in the  Introduction Sessions where it looks like I am being held at gunpoint. ðŸ˜…  I am OK with it, though.  The Product Tour was loose and free, by necessity, however -- I was *really* out of time!  But I definitely prefer that style over the stuffiness that peppers throughout the Introduction Sessions.  

In the end, I am happy with both, but actually prefer the Product Tour as it is way clearer what I am presenting and you can see the features clearly before your eyes.  The Introduction Sessions are still valuable for context, however, as I reference them repeatedly during the Product Tour, so value all around I feel.

### What's Next?!

Probably some rest. :)  I have been pushing myself pretty hard these past few weeks and these past few days especially, so I will be not so gung-ho these next few days while continuing next steps.

That stated, people will run into issues and I will be addressing them accordingly.

This is an exciting time and again the culmination of the efforts for over two years now.  I feel there is a huge opportunity here, exposed by the NFT craze.  It is rather, in fact, a centralized opportunity.  I see starbeam.one as the first of a great many other companies turning into this area, as there is a great deal of market to be explored.

### Thank You!

Alright!  That completes the announcement.  Please do check out the videos as pretty much everything I have wanted to say for the past two years are found in there.

As I end here, a very big thank you goes out to everyone that has supported me during this time ([you know who you are](https://alpha.starbeam.one/about/acknowledgements)!).  Your support and encouragement is so very much appreciated!

Until next time, stay bright. âœŒâœ¨
