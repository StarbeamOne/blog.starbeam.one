### Accepted!

I am so very happy to announce that [Microsoft for Startups](https://startups.microsoft.com/) has accepted my [Founders Hub application](https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/)!

This is beyond exhilarating for me, as this is the first external validation I have received for my product.  This process was very different from the previous one that I experienced with [BizSpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_for_Startups).  Whereas BizSpark seemed to allow anyone into their program, the Founders Hub application seemed more serious and discerning with its candidates.

Importantly, this will go a long way towards cutting my initial costs, as a large amount of my budget was looking at Azure hosting charges (currently $250/mo with my current configuration).

This is huge news in my world, and had to share.

### Presentations

While I am here, a *quick* update with my status.  I am currently knee-deep in PowerPoint and [xSplit Presenter](https://www.xsplit.com/presenter), learning the ropes with these applications while starting to assemble content together for the different sessions.  

Currently on pace to [meet the 22nd announcement](https://blog.starbeam.one/2022/01/february-2022-status-update/#schedule). ðŸ¤žâœŒâœ¨
