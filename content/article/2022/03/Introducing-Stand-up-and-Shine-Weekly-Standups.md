Hello everyone and welcome to your next installment of starbeam.one monthly updates.

Except, it's no longer monthly, but is now *weekly*.  And it's no longer in a blog, but in a *video*.

Yes, I am switching up things here a bit with the format here at starbeam.one.  Going forward, I am going to attempt to update you with a weekly video update in [an agile stand-up format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting), featuring such topics as:

- What I did the previous week
- What I am going to do this week
- Any points of friction/blocking

I am going to try this every week for the next month and see if I can pull it off.  If I cannot, I will dial it back to semi-weekly and see if that suits me better.

Without further ado, here is the first installment:

Before I leave you, I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who has provided support, likes, and valuable feedback in getting the Preview Alpha out the door.  *You are the ones making this possible.*

**Thank you so very very much!**

Until next time, stay bright. ✌✨
