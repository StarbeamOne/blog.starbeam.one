### Announcing Alpha II

Today, I am announcing starbeam.one's Alpha II.  This is the second released alpha for our emerging platform and has a focus on our markets and quality.  This particular alpha has been quite some time in the making, taking over four months [since our Alpha I announcement](https://blog.starbeam.one/2022/10/october-2022-status-update/).

### One-Year Anniversary

One year ago today, after spending over two years in development solitude and surviving a pandemic, I announced the Alpha Preview to much fan fare and overwhelming market acclaim.  

Just kidding.  No one really said any thing and it seemed like they wanted me to go away. ðŸ˜…  

Then, to immediately add insult to injury, [I started having many challenges and difficulties learning cloud infrastruture](https://blog.starbeam.one/2022/04/april-2022-status-update/) and getting all the pieces to work together in unison after the announcement.  It was quite a challenging time and I persisted through all of it, determined to make this work one way or another.

And so here we are.  **One year later and we have some market traction, and have passed our first 1,000 Flares ($1,000) of sales volume** (more on this below).  

Everything we have done thus far has been bootstrapped and 100% organic, growing exclusively from word-of-mouth and personal network referrals.  It has been *incredibly* challenging as one might imagine, but very much worth it.  I feel the community we have is a special one, full of high-quality, understanding, and compassionate members.  In fact, this is so much so that I am actually hesitant to spend any budget on adverstising, for fear of the element it may bring. ðŸ¤”ðŸ‘€

### Let's Explore Some Statzâ„¢

Statzâ„¢ is our technical term for statistics.  Most of our activity and effort has  been on Discord and Twitter to date.  Facebook has not had a lot of traction, neither has Instagram or LinkedIn.  It has been a challenge to get traction anywhere without any ad spend.  Nonethless, we have found some way of doing so on Twitter/Discord.

Here is where we stand currently with all our our social networking:

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MFubTNt4Ph): 73 Members

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/StarbeamOne): 243 Followers

And our own network here on starbeam.one ([via our dashboard](https://alpha.starbeam.one/dashboard)):

### What's New?

### What's Next?

Going forward, I am going to make a concentrated effort to release alphas every two months, culminating in our first beta on August 1st, 2023.  The beta should have us "feature complete" and working on quality toward our first RTM which should be a few months after this.  I am going to wait until we get closer to Beta I to figure out when this might be.

**Alpha III**: April 4th, 2023

**Alpha IV**: June 6th, 2023

**Beta I**: August 1st, 2023
