Yay, the first Tuesday of every month, time for a monthly status update!  Erm, wait, it's Wednesday, huh.  With all the hustle and bustle of running starbeam.one lately, I've dedicated Tuesday to [creating and publishing the Stand-up & Shine (& Shill) video](https://youtu.be/GW3cWCM292o), and then Wednesday to announcing it here with this blog. ‚úå

### 1,500 Flares of Volume (500 in 2 weeks ü§Ø)

It seems like only two weeks ago we managed to reach our first 1,000 Flares of volume after 5.5 months of reaching our first customer.  [Wait, it *was* only two weeks ago!](https://blog.starbeam.one/2023/02/announcing-alpha-ii/)  In the two weeks since, we have now reached 1,500 Flares of total sales volume as of last night.  That's right, *500 Flares in two weeks* which is pretty amazing.  Remember you can [view our latest statistics at any time on our dashboard](https://alpha.starbeam.one/dashboard), you don't even need to be signed in. ‚úå

### Working to Alpha III: A Quality Release

Currently we have Alpha II deployed and I'm now working on some important features that will improve the quality of starbeam.one for Alpha III.  Quality is the focus of Alpha III, where we want some key pieces in place before we start marketing our baby in earnest.  In particular, we want the following in place:

- **Enforce Email Addresses**: Currently email addresses can be used for notifications but they are not required.  Turns out it makes it a lot easier to stay in touch with you (and support you!) as a member if you have this set on your account so we will be making this a requirement when signing in or using the site.
- **Account Merging**: Oauth2 is incredibly powerful but it does have a pesky problem where if you don't remember the provider you signed in with you create a new user account on starbeam.one.  We want to make sure you can merge back with your existing user account and proceed accordingly.
- **Announcement Bot Improvements**: Finally we have some adjustments we want to make with our world-famous announcement bot and will be getting those attended to on our various platforms.

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

That does it for this month's update.  It's going to be another month of development to get us to Alpha III and then from there we can move to Alpha IV and see where that takes us.  For more information around our current state of affairs, I direct you to the latest Stand-up & Shine (& Shill) produced yesterday:

Thank you so much for taking the time here to read what is going on in my world.  I appreciate each and every one of you for showing interest in my project-turned-startup.  Until next time, stay bright out there. üôè‚ú®üöÄ
