### Welcome to Alpha IV

Yay, we made it.  Welcome to Alpha IV, which is the fourth alpha release of starbeam.one.  We're releasing a new alpha every two months on our push to beta which should occur in October. ðŸ¤ž

This was a better alpha for me, [with Alpha III being a bit of a stressful push](https://blog.starbeam.one/2023/04/april-2023-status-update/#welcome-to-alpha-iii).  Alpha IV was better and I felt like I was able to get more done.

Alpha IV had the focus on quality fixes and administrative features.  We can now merge user accounts and close those that do not have any transactions.  We have improved the login experience to help reduce accidentally created accounts.  We also [added the ability for artists to get more capacity by purchasing from other artists](https://starbeam-one.gitbook.io/home/artists/concepts/capacity#buying-capacity).  There are numerous bug fixes and it's starting to feel like we're making some progress again around here with our development.

### Microsoft for Startups Extension

Before I get into the statistics, I wanted to mention that we got a bit of a reprieve lately with our Microsoft for Startups Azure credits.  They were supposed to expire in October, but they got extended to January due to an issue with one of our support tickets.  I am beyond relieved with this development because it gives us an extra three full months of development, which is what I felt we lost in Alpha III as you might recall.

[I go more into this here](https://twitter.com/Mike_E_angelo/status/1660238316430565376).  Thank you very much to Microsoft for Startups for your amazing support and willingness to work with your startups!

### Over 1K Flares of Volume in May, 5K+ Total

Last month I started keeping track of 30-day volume measurements as that seems to be the strongest indicator of growth.  I am pleased to say that we cracked the 1,000 Flare ($1K) volume for the month of May, at 1,079.99 Flares at the closing of May, 30 days.  Our total all-time volume passed 5K Flares as well.  For more statistics [check out our dashboard](https://alpha.starbeam.one/dashboard).

### 213 Users, 93 Artists, 110 Collectors

User growth continues to slowly climb, with approximately 1 new user every day.  We are over 200 users now, approaching 100 artist and over 100 collectors.  [See all our statistics on our dashboard](https://alpha.starbeam.one/dashboard).

### Celebrate One Year of starbeam.one!

We're holding a Twitter Space tomorrow to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of starbeam.one's first market sale.  This [occurred on my birthday last year](https://blog.starbeam.one/2022/06/june-2022-status-update/), and it's already been a full year since this event.  We'll talk about what's happened over the past year, and where we'd like to go.  [Bring some cake and party with us](https://twitter.com/StarbeamOne/status/1665433477829853192). ðŸ¥³
