It is the first week of the month which means it's time for the starbeam.one monthly update!  Usually this occurs on a Tuesday, but since we were celebrating our nation's birthday yesterday it felt a little unpatriotic to do such an activity.  So today it is!

### 1.6K Flares of Volume in June, 54% More than May

Last month I felt like tempting fate by announcing how much volume we did for the month.  I still feel this way but this month we have done well so it continues to be a good decision!  Our recorded 30-day volume for end of June 30th was 1,659.85, a 53.7% increase over June's of 1079.99.

### 238 Users, 105 Artists, 121 Collectors

We are over 100 registered artists which is a huge personal milestone for me.  We continue to onboard new users at *nearly* one new user account per day.

### Quality + Development

Outside of this, I have been focused on quality and development for the next release, scheduled for August 1st.  The focus continues to be on key support features to help onboard users at scaled expectations. ü§û‚ú®üôè

### Prepare for the Betas

One small programming note is that we will be changing the next alpha to our first Beta.  The reason for this is that I have gotten enough feedback from users of the application that the quality of the application is already in beta stage if not more.  I myself am very happy with the quality of the system thus far and have been open to the change, so we will be doing so.

As such, will be following the following schedule if everything goes according to plan (it will go according to plan, won't it?):

- **August 1st, 2023**: Beta I
- **October 3rd, 2023**: Beta II
- **December 5th, 2023**: Beta III
- **February 6th, 2024**: ‚ú® v1.0 RTM ‚ú®
