Believe it or not, we are in the first week of the month, which means the latest starbeam.one Status Update! 🚀

### Welcome to Beta I

At long last, after nearly four years of development, we are now official in beta quality.  Truth be told, we probably have been in beta quality for quite some time now.  Based on feedback from several members, I have made the switch to get this officially acknowledged recognized.

#### Increased Withdrawal Limit

For the beta, our daily withdrawal limits have been raised to $50. 🚀

#### New URL/Address

The "alpha" has been removed from our URL and the application can now be accessed from the root domain name: https://starbeam.one

alpha.starbeam.one is still accepting requests at the moment, but we will be sunsetting it in the near future.  Make sure to update your bookmarks before then!

#### Announcement Bot

The major feature that I have been working on for the past few weeks now is the announcement bot.  It started when Twitter started throwing exceptions in production due to the new API rules.  Since then I have taken this story which was slated for a later release and working on it now.  I have another days' worth of testing and this should be deployed sometime tomorrow.

This is effectively a version two of our announcement bot and it has some considerable improvements.  Consider now when an artist publishes a new product or a sale/resale occurs on the platform it will be announced to the following locations (v1-supported destinations are italicized):

- *Twitter*
- *Discord*
- Facebook
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Pinterest

We may introduce additional channels as time goes on.  Stay tuned. 📢

### ⚡1,014 in July / 269 Users, 115 Artists, 126 Collectors

We did ⚡1,014 Flares of volume in July.  This is down from ⚡1,659 in June.  Cause for concern?  Not yet.  As I mentioned [in the last standup](https://youtu.be/9w9CPwWfrCo), I have been focused on getting features implemented for the Beta, and all focus is on Beta II as the next major event.  As such, a lot of time spent on marketing has been cut and it may impact volume here for the next month or so as we get on more solid ground.

It should be noted that one year ago -- July 2022 -- had zero sales for the entire month.  So, as with anything it's a matter of perspective. 🙃

### Featured on GenAI.TV

One of our members, [Luna Mage](https://starbeam.one/users/46/sales), recently launched [a new site dedicated to generative AI](https://www.genai.tv/), and [posted a neat article featuring starbeam.one](https://www.genai.tv/startups/starbeam-one/). 🚀  Thank you, Luna! 🙏

### What's Next?

We will now spend the next six months in earnest development and get this starship to version 1.0.  Here's what the schedule looks like at present:

- August 1, 2023: Beta I
- October 3rd, 2023: Beta II
- December 5th, 2023: Beta III
- February 6th, 2024: v1.0

As mentioned, all my current efforts and focus is in Beta II, which is really an important milestone.  Once this is complete, we will have some key components in place to assist with support, marketing, and -- importantly -- revenue generation.  A good number of these features and goals have already been on the radar for some time now and it will be a push to finally get them actualized. 💪
