It's the first full week of the month and that means it's time for the latest starbeam.one status update!

### Slow Times on the Starship

Things have gotten slow here, a little slower than anticipated!  This was expected as I spent more time on developing key features for support and administration.  However, the one incident we did not account for was having [our premiere artist account inadvertently getting suspended by Twitter](https://twitter.com/leahgale132/status/1697811347780562974).  Lady Leah is our top artist with over 10,000 followers and was our primary source of marketing and promotion.  Having her account suspended has been a total drag and we are feeling the pain accordingly.

Suspended accounts can take up to two months at present to get re-established, we so we are being patient for now while exploring ways to get the starship back on track.

### August Statistics

- âš¡533 in Volume
- 289 Users
- 118 Artists
- 130 Collectors

### What's Next?

I am focused on getting administrative and support tasks done for Beta II which is slated for next month, October 3rd.  In particular we are requiring email addresses going forward as this will further assist with support and communication with our members.  After this, we want to have a reporting system in place for products so that we can help moderate content on our system.

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

That does it for this month's update.  For more information around our current state of our starship, I direct you to the latest Stand-up & Shine (& Shill):
