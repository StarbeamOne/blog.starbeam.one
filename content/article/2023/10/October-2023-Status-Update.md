### Welcome to Beta II

Welcome to the second beta of starbeam.one.  This is a quality-based beta with certain key support features.

#### Email Address Policy

We now require email addresses for accounts.  If you have an existing account and have already added+confirmed an email address, this has been automatically done for you.  Otherwise, you will get a prompt to provide and verify an email address.

New accounts will also be prompted.

This was a much larger story than anticipated.  As it does involve security, it did take extra time.  We also now have better integration with our support channels, with our Crisp Chat window in particular, which requires an email address for full functionality.

### Beta II Gift: Extra Capacity!

I am happy to announce that all existing artists have been gifted extra capacity in their Featured and Standard Market accounts.  Existing Featured Market capacity accounts have been given 25 units, and Standard Market capacity accounts have been given 5 units.  Thank you for using starbeam.one and helping to develop our startup.  Your efforts and participation are greatly appreciated!

### Extra Artist Purchase Reward

Another extra that we have added for artists is that extra capacity is awarded on artist purchases.  When you purchase from another artist and are low on capacity, the amount of capacity awarded to you is now doubled.  For instance, if you purchase a Featured Market license for 3 Flares, you will get 6 units of capacity.  If you purchase a Standard Market license for 1 Flare, you get 2 units of capacity awarded back to you.

### Current Schedule

With the extra work that the email address policy added, as well as general grind of running a startup, I wasn't able to complete nearly the amount of features I was aiming for this beta.  As such, I have added an extra beta to the works before we go RTM/v1.0.

The current schedule is:

- **Beta III**: December 5th, 2023
- **Beta IV**: February 3rd, 2024
- **RTM/v1.0**: April 2nd, 2024

### Spooky AI Art Contest

One quick mention here, [we have our first contest](https://vote.vertikal.art/contest/spooky/)!  Several users have suggested this in the past and I am happy to declare we have our first offering in this regard.  We are teaming up with [VaVortex AI Community](https://twitter.com/VertikalAiVortx/) to handle our contest, and we will be hosting the products for purchase after the contest completion.  [Visit this page for details](https://vote.vertikal.art/contest/spooky/).  

This is our first contest and should be considered a v1.0 trial.  As time goes on we hope to improve the experience and further our partnership with VaVortex. üëç‚ú®üöÄ

### What's Next?

Now begins the process for the next beta.  Before doing so, I have some cleanup work for Beta II and removing unused modeling.  After this is done, the next beta will commence, slated for December 5th.

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

I still have to record this month's standup which should be later today, the 3rd.  Please check back here for updates!
