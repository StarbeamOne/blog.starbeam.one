### Two Years Since Preview Announcement

From the better late than never file, this update is a *little* behind this month. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‡  I have been busy working on our new environment and configurations for v1.0.  With all the activity and effort to make this happen, I decided to round out the delay to this week as it signifies a full two years since announcing the preview on February 22, 2022.  Difficult to believe and accept that this is the case!  It has been an incredible journey thus far, where there's been more learning than profit.  I hope to reverse that trend in the next year (or two). ðŸ¤ž

### Welcome to v1.0

Last we spoke, I was saying how Beta III could be considered v1.0.  However, there was the little matter of getting it deployed with some optimizations to the solution structure.  Well one thing led to another and I ended up rewriting our Azure deployments and deployed environment. ðŸ˜…  We are now fully automated with our Azure deployments which makes it so much nicer to manage and maintain.  There is a cost-savings aspect to this as it not only optimizes our environment/resource utilization, but now I do not have to worry about hiring an Azure engineer because I am that person. ðŸ¤“

It took two months to get here since Beta III, but we are here and I am very happy with the results.  There is the consideration that no new features have been implemented during this time.  This is a source of stress for me but having a deployment environment that feels much more under control is worth that cost.

In addition to our production environment, we now feature an on-demand testing environment that can be stood up in about 10 minutes.  We also feature an on-demand preview environment that does the same thing as the testing environment but also copies all the data from production, giving us essentially a cloned production environment to test major changes in before actually deploying them.

All things considered it was worth the two-month detour here to solve these pressing challenges with our deployments.  They will help out a lot as we move forward with our next goals.

### What's Next

With that, I can finally start working on "subscriptions" or Automatic Purchasing as I am calling it now.  But before this I want to further optimize our model and improve our publishing process.  From there it will make it easier to add this feature and so much more.  I am so happy to be able to focus on this now that we have our deployments squared away. ðŸ˜Œ
