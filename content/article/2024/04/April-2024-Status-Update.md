It's the first week of the month here at starbeam.one.  This means the latest monthly status update. ✨🚀

### v1.1 Released

I was finally able to deploy v1.1 last month, which includes all sorts of quality updates to v1.0.  With that release I *finally* caught up with all the technical debt I had been enduring and battling for the past few months.  I am *so* glad that is over and I am able to *finally* get back to feature development.

### v1.2 Under Development

I am now actively developing v1.2 and I cannot express how excited I am to be here, *finally*. 😁  v1.2 has a July timeframe for deployment and will feature a new model for publishing products to our marketplace, along with a new interface to do so.

This is all code that I first developed nearly five years ago and boy does it hit the feels.  It's difficult to accept that I have been working on this project for nearly half a decade now. 🤯  It's been quite the blessing and I am hoping no less than to see this to the success of this project and to make it profitable.  I have about a year's worth of runway remaining to make that happen, and it's going to be a hustle the entire time.

### What's Next?

After v1.2 in July, we then finally set our sights on v1.3 which will finally include automatic purchasing (aka "subscriptions").  I really hope to have this done by October, which will officially mark 5 years.  Then it's off to the races with getting signups again and working on a new secret 🤫 feature for v2.0, slated for January 2025.  More details around this as development progresses. 🤞

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

That does it for this month's update.  For more information around our current state of our beloved starship, I direct you to the latest Stand-up & Shine (& Shill):
