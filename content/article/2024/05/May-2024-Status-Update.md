It's the first week of the month.  This means the latest monthly status update here at starbeam.one. ‚ú®üöÄ

### Accepted in LEAP's Fund Your Acceleration Cohort #4

I am happy to announce that starbeam.one has been accepted into LEAP's [Fund Your Acceleration](https://www.purelansing.com/fund-your-acceleration/) Cohort #4.  This is a local program here in Lansing, funded by the state of Michigan.  The program provides grants to pay for qualified services ranging from legal to marketing.  While I am currently applying for such services, the primary value to me is connections and networking. üëç  It's been a long 4+ years here, and everything accomplished under sb1 has been done exclusively by me.  As great as a personal accomplishment that is, there is definitely a sense now that I should be branching out and getting assistance where I can.  The FYA program is a good way of doing this.

### v1.2 Underway

Adding to the excitement is active development for v1.2.  *It is so very nice to get back into new feature development* rather than slaving mercilessly over technical debt.  I believe I [mentioned this in my last post](https://blog.starbeam.one/2024/04/april-2024-status-update/), but I am so overwhelmed with joy that I have to mention it again. üôè

I did mention last time that v1.2 had a July timeframe but I can already tell you that has been moved to about September with all the changes that are happening.  A good reminder to never establish expectations. üòÖ

This is basically a new publishing model and a lot of refactoring has occurred.  I am making good progress ([check out the new beneficiary control for starters](https://twitter.com/Mike_E_angelo/status/1787396542002770389)), but in the end software development moves glacially slow and takes time.  There is also the fact that once this new model is in place I will have to migrate the existing (production) model over to it.  That is going to be a lot of work, possibly a month.  We will see. ü§û

### You Are Here üéØ

It's good to take inventory from time to time and I wanted to take a moment here to relay where I feel this project is at the moment.  I started this in October 2019 and I am beyond amazed that nearly 5 years has already transpired.  I opened the marketplace out of preview in June 2022, which means that it has quickly approaching two full years since it has opened. ü§Ø

As a marketplace, we have processed over $11K of volume comprised of over 6,500 sales.  This is an awesome personal accomplishment (the most money I have ever made via software personally), but at the end of the day I am not entirely happy with the system or the model, which mostly operates as a "alternative NFT" marketplace (without a blockchain of course).  Seems like there are a million NFT marketplaces, and even though I managed to accomplish making one without a blockchain, I don't find the model compelling enough.  Like many others, I am not exactly fond of NFT marketplaces, either.  I visit quite a few of these and none of them really seem all that interesting.  There is just *so much art* and the process (or content) overall does not really have a lot of appeal.  

You can see this confirmed by visiting the activity tabs of any of the artists.  By and large, most artists on NFT marketplaces *have very little activity*.  Those who do have notable activity tend to operate in spurts and it is not consistent or long-term viable.

Because of this, I have not yet reached the point where I feel comfortable marketing sb1 and trying to onboard users in earnest.  "Hey try out the sorta NFT marketplace I built and I am not entirely happy with" is not the most viable of marketing strategies.  I am not sure it will attract the type of person we want to build a community around, either.  Sure, I could *lie* and fake my way to more users and business, but then I would *truly* be yet another NFT platform. üòè

### What's Next?

So, the pressure is on.  I have been studying this space closely since opening the doors in June 2022.  Since that time, I have landed on a set of key features that I believe will not only make sb1 stand out, but also get it to profitability.  Unfortunately, it's going to take a lot of time and effort to get there, but I am committed to getting as far as I can -- hopefully, to completion.  I have been burning through my savings and also [PUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_insurance_in_the_United_States#COVID-19_pandemic_(2020-2021)) to get to this point.  Luckily, I still have nearly a year of runway left if all goes well.  Doing some estimates (and we know how those go), it looks like I can get these key features in around December of this year.  That will leave about 3-4 months of remaining runway to start marketing (assuming everything is completed on time, which is challenging in its own right).

That is cutting it close to the end of runway, I know.  Once that kicks in, that should stop the bleeding a bit and we can start possible marketing initiatives. ü§û

Of course, a lot can happen between now and December, but that's the plan I have now.

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)
