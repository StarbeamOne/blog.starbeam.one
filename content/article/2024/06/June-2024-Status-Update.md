It's the first week of the month, that means it's time for a status update here on starbeam.one! ✨

### starbeam.one's Marketplace is 2 Years Old 🚀

Can you believe it's already been two full years since I opened starbeam.one's doors to the public with [the first product release of my work, Cause](https://starbeam.one/market/licenses/1)? 🤯  I made seven sales that day and it was quite the event for me.  Of course, after this not much happened for some time.  I had zero artists outside of myself who were using the platform, and I learned very quickly the monumental challenge in getting any sort of traction.  In fact, it would not be until September 2022 that I onboarded my first artist and *oof* was *that* an adventure (hint: many bugs were uncovered). 

But here we are now two years later without much marketing effort, landing over 150 artists and nearly 7,000 sales, all by word-of-mouth and personal invitations.  We've also published over 11,000 licenses [which you can browse here](https://starbeam.one/market/licenses). 😊  I hope once we have the new features in place within the next year (they will be in place won't they? 🤔) we can get serious about marketing and start getting some real traction. 🤞

### Birthday Contest

I wanted to mention real quickly the really popular and successful contest that is being run for sb1 by our friends VaVortex.  [This grassroots campaign](https://x.com/VAVortex/status/1795094602858299626) has over 10k views which is pretty tough to do organically on X.  The contest itself has over 40 entries as of this morning.  [Check it out here!](https://vote.vertikal.art/contest/scifi/) ✨🚀

### New Publishing Wizard is Underway

Outside of this, I am busy working away at the new publishing wizard.  This is a complete rewrite of how products are published, accounting for all the (painful) lessons encountered over the past two years.  This is going to be a much better experience once it is all completed.  If interested you can view an example of the video uploads and [what this looks like in the new version](https://x.com/Mike_E_angelo/status/1797909594699698483).  There is also the [new source/preview/thumbnail experience](https://x.com/Mike_E_angelo/status/1796080179887886438).

The idea is that the artist will only have to upload one file and we take care of the rest. 🙏

### What's Next?

The new publishing wizard is v1.2 for the product.  I hope to have this done by October, which will mark a full 5 years of working on starbeam.one since inception. 🤯 

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

That does it for this month's update.  For more information around our current state of our beloved starship, I direct you to the latest Stand-up & Shine (& Shill):
