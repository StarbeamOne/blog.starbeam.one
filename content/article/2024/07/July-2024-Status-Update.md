It''s the first Tuesday (or Wednesday 😊) of the month.  That means it's time for the latest status update for starbeam.one! 🎨🚀✨

### New Publishing Wizard Development Continues

This is a shorter update, as really there has only been one item of interest to report on this past month: the New Publishing Wizard. 🧙‍♂️

I continue to develop the next version of the publishing model, which includes the New Publishing Wizard.  This is a step-by-step wizard that guides the artist through the publishing process, and is a re-write for the entire previous experience.

I am currently working on the first step which is the most involved, the file upload step.  I have made some good progress and am aiming for an experience where the artist simply drags over a file and the product is automatically built around it, leaving very little effort to be done by the artist.

It is taking a little (read: a lot 😇😁) more time than expected, but the resulting vision and experience is worth it.

I should also mention that I am integrating Azure AI and am starting to learn the ropes there.  This will assist greatly with content + image analysis and moderation going forward.  It will also assist in pre-filling fields and tagging the content, getting back to helping the artist out with defining the product.

### Stand-up & Shine (& Shill)

That does it for this month's update.  For more information around our current state of our beloved starship, I direct you to the latest Stand-up & Shine (& Shill):
