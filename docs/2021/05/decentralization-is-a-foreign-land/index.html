        <p>Continuing my spontaneous series here. üòÅ</p>
<p>I have been studying the decentralized space since late June 2017, so nearly four years now.  If I was attending college then you could say that I am a graduate in such matters (assuming I acquired all my credits, something I failed to do in real live BUT I DIGRESS).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain quality or metric that has seemed elusive to decentralization during that time, and that is adoption.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that it seems that it <em>is</em> being adopted, but to me it seems that <em>mass</em> (or viral) adoption is not taking place.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, in my estimation, the decentralized mindset is so foreign.  It is completely different to how you typically approach societal life that it takes a considerable adjustment &ndash; much like visiting a foreign country:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lost your seed words/password/keys?  Tough luck. You&rsquo;ve now lost access to the entire value of the wallet that stores it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>Got scammed out of your entire wallet value?  &ldquo;Should have done your research ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&rdquo; (common refrain from crypto apologists).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-robbery-torture-cryptocurrency-netherlands-a8807986.html">Got tortured with a drill until you gave up your keys</a>?  Well, should have known what &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/be-your-own-bank-with-bitcoin/">being your own bank</a>&rdquo; really means. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>Someone <a href="https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/06/your-private-key-can-be-guessed/">guessed your private key</a>?  What, you didn&rsquo;t have the 4-5 years to study this space to find out how it really works? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>These sorts of barriers are difficult to adjust to, and are not for everyone (especially with the prominently cynical &amp; critical attitude from the crypto community, but that&rsquo;s another topic altogether).  This might explain why artists can get their friends and family to onboard onto the NFT hype (adoption) but struggle getting <em>their friends' friends and family</em> to onboard (mass adoption).</p>
<p>While decentralization promotes self-responsibility and individual sovereignty, what it fails to account for is a very basic human truth, particularly in peace time: <em>people are lazy</em>.</p>
<p>Services that account for this laziness and meet the lazy where they are, are the businesses that meet the most success.  Look no further than Coinbase.  A company that takes a complicated, foreign matter like cryptocurrency and makes it familiar in a centralized way.  It was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/04/13/coinbase-is-not-worth-100b-and-its-stock-could-double-on-its-ipo/?sh=10c86c13461c">recently valued at $100 billion</a> when opening to the market.  Sure, Coinbase is loathed by crypto &ldquo;Not your keys not your crypto&rdquo; purists.  But do Coinbase users care?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.starbeam.one/images/5bh1re.jpg" alt="But Do They Care?"></p>
<p>Again, <em>people are lazy</em> and want others to do the work for them.  (Behold, the free market to the rescue!)  So what if it&rsquo;s not their keys?  They have taken the time to fork over their private information in adherence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a>  and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp">AML</a> laws.  They are most likely law-abiding citizens that are simply apathetic to the technical complexity of &ldquo;owning your keys.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Not your Bitcoin, not your easy money&rdquo; is more like their overarching motto.</p>
<p>And that is where Coinbase excels.  You can own all the cryptocurrency you want and they take care of the details.  Just fork over all your personally private information &ndash; you know, like you have done with many other services &ndash; and they will take care of the rest.  This <em>feels</em> familiar and is almost basically expected, which is part of the reason it is so successful and has been valuated so highly.</p>
<p>That is why we have a free market, after all: to enable an efficient environment where you can create a service that improves the lives of those that use it.</p>
<p>All this to say that what starbeam.one offers is a vision that operates much like Coinbase: make a difficult foreign land more familiar and accessible.  Whereas Coinbase specializes in trading and currencies, starbeam.one is their &ldquo;NFT equivalent&rdquo; (however it is our view that <a href="https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/05/the-opportunity-as-i-see-it/">they are digital licenses, not NFTs</a>.).</p>
<p>Currently, with the NFT space users are forced into a foreign land and if they run into problems, well, better luck next time.  This is completely different from what they <em>expect</em>: <strong>recourse for when things go wrong</strong>.  Remember, people are lazy, so when things go wrong they want someone to fix it for them &ndash; &ldquo;<em>right freaking now!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a centralized system, this is a piece of cake.  We simply reverse the transaction and everything was as before (assuming appropriate and authorized controls, of course).  Here, we allow users to utilize a familiar system, get comfortable with it, <em>then</em> offer them the means to off-ramp into their foreign land once they deemed fit and are comfortable with assuming the risk of drill saw torture and other perils.</p>
<p>This gives the user choice and flexibility, something that simply doesn&rsquo;t exist in the current market, making a foreign land a little less foreign. ‚úå</p>
