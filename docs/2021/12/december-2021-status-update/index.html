        <p>Greetings and Happy Holidays.  Here is your next installment of starbeam.one monthly updates.</p>
<p>I feel the need to say this each time, but yes, I am still alive. 😊  I am also a bit late this time around, having skipped the November update.  Originally, I was aiming for the middle of November, but the final feature task that I was working on took way longer than I anticipated&hellip; <em>again</em>. 😅😭</p>
<p>With that, I took the few weeks to round out that final story and decided to round out to the next month, and here we are.  Going forward, I will aim for the first Tuesday of every month with an update.  So with that, let&rsquo;s get on with the show here.</p>
<h4 id="marketplace-application-feature-complete">Marketplace Application Feature Complete!</h4>
<p>I am pleased to announce that after many <em>many</em> months of refactoring and delays with &ldquo;perfection,&rdquo; the marketplace application is feature complete and ready for deployment.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/37-Days-Launch-Ryan-Duques/dp/142765137X">I know I know, I shouldn&rsquo;t be spending so much time being &ldquo;perfect,&quot;</a> (and in fact refer to this rather tongue-in-cheek) but when I say &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; I really mean &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t obviously break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, it works on my machine and is ready for testing on another.</p>
<p>This last leg has been <em>especially</em> brutal.  In addition to a few fundamental <a href="https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/10/october-2021-status-update/">refactorings with the data access and a re-write of the identity system</a>, the last final feature was more involved than anticipated.  I had it pegged for 10 days and it ended up being 20.  To refresh, my days are 10-12 hours, no weekends, so it has been an absolute slog.  I finished on December 2nd and have been attending to minor tasks since then, taking a &ldquo;break&rdquo; of sorts.</p>
<h4 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h4>
<p>What a great question.  I&rsquo;m glad I had you ask me. 😄  Two days ago I had one answer for you (&ldquo;Primordial Alpha&rdquo;), but now that I have had some clear time to think some more, I have another one that I like better (&ldquo;Playground Alpha&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore.</p>
<h4 id="primordial-alpha--its-challenges">Primordial Alpha + Its Challenges</h4>
<p>What is the Primordial Alpha?  Well, I&rsquo;ve gone back and forth on exactly what this is.  Initially, I envisioned having a very well-secured application that is only accessible via Allowed List.  However, there are some &ldquo;chicken-egg&rdquo; challenges with doing so.</p>
<p>First is how do creators onboard their potential customers?  We have to Allow List them as well, and that immediately becomes a challenge.  Either I have to create a mechanism that enables them to do so and/or they have to go through a process that may or may not be intuitive/rewarding/positive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wanting a good first impression here, or as close to one as possible.  Considering that the primary goal is to see what breaks &ndash; which may be <em>everything</em> &ndash; I would rather reduce the amount of friction required to onboard users into the system for kicking its tires.</p>
<p>In addition to onboarding creators and their users, there are other challenges.  First is legal and other parties that require access to the system for review.  It&rsquo;s easier to have something deployed and easily accessible when I send it to them.  Sure, again, I could have sign-in/security mechanisms but historically I have never had much luck with them and end up being more trouble than its worth.</p>
<p>Also, those sign-in/security mechanisms are an issue of their own.  Authentication into starbeam.one is handled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">exclusively by Oauth2 providers</a>, courtesy of ASP.NET Core&rsquo;s built-in security providers and the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers">aspnet-contrib package</a> (of which <a href="https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers/commit/014ef58416b9f6dca6ec88a4b7f4e5936ebb2acf#diff-97022d3ec3825bb5f18eb629bf5a25e0baf9db076c3ba296f13839061e7096c0">I am a contributor</a>! 🎉).  Each one of those goes through a review process, and the review team requires access to the application to verify it conforms to their individual established policies.  Giving access to these teams has been a challenging riddle to me for some time.  Again, doing a security wall is challenging and there always seems to be a problem.  So what&rsquo;s the best way of providing access while getting approval?</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of onramp and exit ramps with fiat currency.  I am using PayPal for both, and Coinbase for onramping.  There is currently no viable exit ramp for Coinbase.  Well there is, <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ios-sdk/issues/54">but it simply does not work, and I am very irritated with that</a>.  Let&rsquo;s just say that Coinbase appears to have very little to no support for their development offerings, and I struggle to see why they have such a high valuation.</p>
<p>So, I have been looking at <a href="https://bitpay.com/online-payments">BitPay</a> instead.  They offer a promising solution, but it has revenue requirements.  Again, I would like to show them the working product and demonstrate what I have in mind and see what is possible.</p>
<h4 id="the-solution-the-playground-alpha">The Solution: The Playground Alpha</h4>
<p>So what is the solution?  It wasn&rsquo;t until yesterday that I thought of something: why not simply deploy the application in all its (potentially broken 😁) operational glory with the exception of &ldquo;live&rdquo; deposit and withdrawal functionality?  Deposit and withdrawal will still be &ldquo;available&rdquo; but they will be &ldquo;no-op,&rdquo; meaning they really do not do anything consequential.</p>
<p>I call it&hellip; <em>The Playground Alpha!</em></p>
<p>To clarify further, depositing will be possible via &ldquo;faucet&rdquo; where you can debit (fake/system-provided) money into your account, and the withdrawal will credit your account but will not actually send it anywhere.</p>
<p>So, everything <em>appears</em> to be working and is fully functional as deployed, but no actual &ldquo;real&rdquo; money will be utilized.</p>
<p>This way, the application can be viewed by all and I can start collecting all the valuable feedback immediately &ndash; including and especially what breaks.  I can also start pointing dependent parties towards the location and having reviews done to further proceed with chicken-egg scenarios.</p>
<p>Boom.  I then anticipate a 2-3 month period where I tackle obvious problems while implementing BitPay/other on/off-ramps and get this to a deployable alpha where it can be used for real in a &ldquo;live money&rdquo; setting, all the while building some sort of confidence in the system.</p>
<h4 id="schedule">Schedule</h4>
<p>All told, this is what I currently have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>December 2021:</strong> Playground Alpha Preparation</li>
<li><strong>January 2022:</strong> Deployment to Azure/Marketing Video Tour</li>
<li><strong>February 2022:</strong> Playground Alpha (No-op Deposit/Withdrawal)</li>
<li><strong>April 2022:</strong> Alpha (Live Deposit/Withdrawal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is a chance that the schedule might accelerate, based on all sorts of conditions, primarily that of the quality of code and how well it reacts once under test.</p>
<p>And, of course, There is also a chance the schedule could slip.  In addition to things Breaking Badly™,  I am now officially on the clock and I do not operate well under pressure. 🙃</p>
<p>But, we&rsquo;re getting closer here.  This is feeling more and more real every day and I am having to deal with the stress of such.  In a good way, I swear! 😅</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this month&rsquo;s installment.  Until next time, stay bright. ✌✨</p>
