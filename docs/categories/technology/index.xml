      <description>Goodness, has it been two months already? I have been in a total coding slog since the last checkin, having to battle two coding fronts that address technical debt concerns:
 Identity System (95% complete) Entity Framework Data Access Refactor (65% complete)  The Entity Framework story is a bit further along than it suggests. Part of the issue is that currently all worker processes run in session scope, which makes sense.</description>

      <description>Well I am still kicking and coding here. I wanted to take a breath here and check in with progress. Not that there is much of any. üòÖüò≠
While I have been plugging some insane hours lately, I have recently been ambushed by the identity system. It was basically like writing a whole new application. What I have built, however, is pretty neat and I am happy with it. Unfortunately, it has pushed my schedule out further, however, so I am trying to deal with the anxiety that goes along with it.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s July, and as mentioned last time, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a break. Except&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take a break. üòÖüò≠ I think I mentioned that I am working on the identity system. Indeed, I have taken a wrecking ball to this sucker and it is now officially wrecked. I&amp;rsquo;ve been picking up the pieces and putting them back together, but it&amp;rsquo;s been taking WAY longer than expected.</description>

      <title>Your Private Key Can Be Guessed</title>
      <link>https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/06/your-private-key-can-be-guessed/</link>

      <description>One final thought here and I&amp;rsquo;ll finish. I promise. üòÅ
In addition to some of the risks I outlined earlier in this article with regards to cryptocurrency, there&amp;rsquo;s one in particular that I feel needs extra mention. Namely, the private key that keeps your value safe is simply a number: a very very very large number.
That conceivably means that if someone guesses that number, they have access to your wallet.</description>

      <title>Decentralization Is a Foreign Land</title>
      <link>https://blog.starbeam.one/2021/05/decentralization-is-a-foreign-land/</link>

      <description>Continuing my spontaneous series here. üòÅ
I have been studying the decentralized space since late June 2017, so nearly four years now. If I was attending college then you could say that I am a graduate in such matters (assuming I acquired all my credits, something I failed to do in real live BUT I DIGRESS).
There&amp;rsquo;s a certain quality or metric that has seemed elusive to decentralization during that time, and that is adoption.</description>

      <title>The Blockchain is Just an Application</title>

      <description>The blockchain is just an application. Everyone is going nuts over blockchain now that they see it can be used for commerce, despite its awkwardness and efficiency concerns. In the hysteria, the whole premise of the blockchain has taken on a bigger concept than it actually is.
But let&amp;rsquo;s keep in mind that a blockchain is basically an application. It&amp;rsquo;s an application that runs on one or more computers (nodes) that comprise a network.</description>

      <title>The Opportunity as I See It</title>

      <description>To my mind, the &amp;ldquo;Creator Economy&amp;rdquo; (buzzwords, ugh) is much like the &amp;ldquo;Real Estate Economy&amp;rdquo; (üòõ) and can be divided into two segments:
 Digital leasing Digital ownership  Digital leasing should be familiar to anyone who has owned a computer since forever. It&amp;rsquo;s really the only way we have interfaced with digital &amp;ldquo;assets&amp;rdquo; ever since we have been able to copy them into a directory and subsequently paste them infinitely across as many devices we own and/or illicit networks of which we may (or may not üòá) be a member.</description>

      <description>Goodness, what a run. I have basically been on a development tear since the last check-in, clocking about 10-12 hours a day. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s my typical schedule, but all of it has been totally dedicated to disciplined development, which is the ideal.
So upon last check-in I believe I was spilling about having some videos done by now, which WAS ALL A LIE. üòÖ Shows you for taking the time to believe me.</description>

      <description>Well, another checkin so it must mean I am stuck somewhere again. üòÅ Indeed, another bout of &amp;ldquo;The Analysis&amp;rdquo; has struck, so I am left staring at the ceiling for hours at a time, awaiting the inspiration to save me.
There&amp;rsquo;s also Twitter, which I find myself switching to uncontrollably to find the latest news &amp;ndash; whatever it may be.
I am getting close, however. This is the last task involving &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; analysis, and this is one of three tasks (or stories) remaining.</description>

      <title>Analysis Is the Most Difficult</title>

      <description>Of all the phases of development, analysis is the most difficult. For me, at least. I am currently the business analyst for my startup. Well, technically, I am every freaking role of my startup as I am the only one working on it right now. However, what I mostly do is analysis, user experience, and of course, software development.
Out of each of those, analysis is the most challenging for me.</description>

      <title>Hello World!</title>

      <description>Hello world!
I am excited to announce my efforts here with The Starbeam Project. Although, in my life I have found that it is best not to mention intention and plans but to actually put forth the effort.
If all goes well, this project will represent the next phase and major chapter in my life. I am pretty pumped about this vision and plan to spend the next several years developing it in one form or another.</description>
