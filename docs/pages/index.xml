      <description>Welcome to The Starbeam Project Blog!
I am your host, Michael DeMond &amp;ndash; aka Mike-E, or perhaps for the purposes of this project, Mike-E-angelo. With a little luck, I hope to have the chance to explain why at some point. üòÅ
This is a little place that I have carved out in the interwebs for my latest project, Starbeam! With this blog, I hope to have a resource that I can utilize to share status updates regarding my new crazy idea, along with any other quick thoughts or dissertations that I wish to disperse to the public.</description>
