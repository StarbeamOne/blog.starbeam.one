      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s New? We have supported PayPal Payouts since the market opened in June 2022. At that time, my impression and understanding was that fees for this service were $0.25 for each payout. It turns out this is accurate, but only for US-only payouts. International payouts are 2%.
This misunderstanding was caught pretty quickly when we started to process international payouts, which comprise a majority of our payouts.
While it has been known for sometime, I am just now getting around to fixing it.</description>
