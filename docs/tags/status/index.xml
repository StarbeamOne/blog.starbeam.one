      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first week of the month, and that historically means it&amp;rsquo;s time for our monthly status update here on starbeam.one! üöÄ
Back on Schedule-ish I say historically as last month was a bit of an outlier. We&amp;rsquo;re back to the first week of the month here with our cadence, and what I have been doing is filming the standup on Tuesday and then writing the blog posts on the following day.</description>

      <description>Two Years Since Preview Announcement From the better late than never file, this update is a little behind this month. üòäüòá I have been busy working on our new environment and configurations for v1.0. With all the activity and effort to make this happen, I decided to round out the delay to this week as it signifies a full two years since announcing the preview on February 22, 2022. Difficult to believe and accept that this is the case!</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month, it is time for a monthly status update! üöÄ
Welcome to Beta III I am very happy to announce that today we have Beta III. This is mostly a quality release, addressing a lot of issues for administration and user account management.
With this monthly update, I am going to take some time here and reflect where we are here after four years of development, with (at present) another year of runway to make something of it in a viable way.</description>

      <description>Wow it is already November, with roughly two more months left in 2023. ü§Ø It is also the first Tuesday of the month so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a monthly update. ‚ú®üöÄ
Back on Track, Sort of&amp;hellip; I am very happy to announce the return of Lady Leah. This was a huge ordeal for us, as we had to deal with a lot of Twitter dysfunction to resolve this issue &amp;ndash; which was that her account was suspended without reason or warning.</description>

New accounts will also be prompted.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first full week of the month and that means it&amp;rsquo;s time for the latest starbeam.one status update!
Slow Times on the Starship Things have gotten slow here, a little slower than anticipated! This was expected as I spent more time on developing key features for support and administration. However, the one incident we did not account for was having our premiere artist account inadvertently getting suspended by Twitter. Lady Leah is our top artist with over 10,000 followers and was our primary source of marketing and promotion.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, we are in the first week of the month, which means the latest starbeam.one Status Update! üöÄ
Welcome to Beta I At long last, after nearly four years of development, we are now official in beta quality. Truth be told, we probably have been in beta quality for quite some time now. Based on feedback from several members, I have made the switch to get this officially acknowledged recognized.</description>

      <description>It is the first week of the month which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for the starbeam.one monthly update! Usually this occurs on a Tuesday, but since we were celebrating our nation&amp;rsquo;s birthday yesterday it felt a little unpatriotic to do such an activity. So today it is!
1.6K Flares of Volume in June, 54% More than May Last month I felt like tempting fate by announcing how much volume we did for the month.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Alpha IV Yay, we made it. Welcome to Alpha IV, which is the fourth alpha release of starbeam.one. We&amp;rsquo;re releasing a new alpha every two months on our push to beta which should occur in October. ü§û
This was a better alpha for me, with Alpha III being a bit of a stressful push. Alpha IV was better and I felt like I was able to get more done.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first week of the month, time for your monthly status update for starbeam.one!
Welcome to May We are here in May, with Alpha IV scheduled for launch next month. It is very heads-down for me (a good thing) and this post will be short-and-sweet.
880 Flares of Volume, Passing 3,500 Total Last month we did 880 Flares of volume for the month, which is pretty impressive considering we did 81 total for the month of December.</description>

Welcome to Alpha III Today we&amp;rsquo;re announcing Alpha III, which is mostly comprised of quality improvements.
Alpha III was meant to be a focus on quality and also key features on administration before we start marketing our application in earnest with formal advertising spend. However, with all the sheer commotion of onboarding new users, artists, and collectors, I only managed to get quality improvements into the codebase for this alpha.</description>

      <description>Yay, the first Tuesday of every month, time for a monthly status update! Erm, wait, it&amp;rsquo;s Wednesday, huh. With all the hustle and bustle of running starbeam.one lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated Tuesday to creating and publishing the Stand-up &amp;amp; Shine (&amp;amp; Shill) video, and then Wednesday to announcing it here with this blog. ‚úå
1,500 Flares of Volume (500 in 2 weeks ü§Ø) It seems like only two weeks ago we managed to reach our first 1,000 Flares of volume after 5.</description>

      <description>Today, I am announcing starbeam.one&amp;rsquo;s Alpha II. This is the second released alpha for our emerging platform and has a focus on our markets and quality. This particular alpha has been quite some time in the making, taking over four months since our Alpha I announcement.
One-Year Anniversary One year ago today, after spending over two years in development solitude and surviving a pandemic, I announced the Alpha Preview to much fan fare and overwhelming market acclaim.</description>

      <description>Hello February! It is the first Tuesday (or Wednesday as of late üòá) of the month and therefore time for your starbeam.one monthly status update.
Nearly One Year Has Passed üöÄ I announced the preview on February 22, 2022. Can you believe that in two weeks that will be one full year? ü§Ø This time last year I was uploading the different applications to Azure and learning a lot. One year later, we are actively generating revenue and running a business.</description>

      <description>Hello out there and welcome to the latest starbeam.one monthly update. As you know, I usually aim to have these out on the first Tuesday of every month. While I was able to attend to the video recording for Stand-up &amp;amp; Shine yesterday, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to everything else, so here we are. ü•≥
Happy New Year! With that, I would like to wish everyone a happy 2023. May it be a successful one for you and all.</description>

      <description>Season&amp;rsquo;s greetings!
Woohoo, the first week of the month, and that means a status update for starbeam.one! ‚ú®üöÄ
500 Sales! Nearly 150 Flares ($150) in Volume! We continue our completely organic non-advertising push here to build our market. As expected, this is a slow process but one that helps build confidence in the system at a slow and steady pace.
As this is my first rodeo into the modern market I am OK with taking my time before bringing on new users through financial spending.</description>

A Week Off It is indeed the second Tuesday of the month. I usually aim for the first Tuesday, but I have recently been running into troubles with my recording software and they have been thankfully resolved. So today we are back on track, recording today and again in two weeks from now on the 22nd.</description>

Welcome to the Phase I Alpha! Today marks the official beginning of the Phase I Alpha (or &amp;ldquo;Alpha I&amp;rdquo;) of starbeam.one. As you might recall, we started with the preview back in February, and then the Friends &amp;amp; Family Alpha in June.
Since then it&amp;rsquo;s been a mad dash to arrive to this point.</description>

Finishing Tasks The past few weeks have been really focused on the Administration Application, which can be viewed as a CMS application around the entire starbeam.one system. I wanted a way to quickly jump through all the different entities of the system and I am pleased to say that I finally have a first version that I am happy with using.</description>

Program Notes Astute readers will realize that I am posting this on a Thursday, and not a Tuesday. While I was able to record the latest Stand-up &amp;amp; Shine (and Shill) on Tuesday, I was not able to post it until this morning. There were a few issues with post-video production that took quite a bit of time and retakes.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s time for your starbeam.one monthly update.
It Be Awkward There&amp;rsquo;s an expression that I learned from Jim Caldwell, a former Detroit Lions coach (and still my favorite after Jim Schwartz). He used an expression that, turns out, is also used in the military: get comfortable being uncomfortable.
That&amp;rsquo;s sort of where I am at with the present moment.</description>

What is It? The friends and family alpha is pretty much the same product and release as the alpha preview released back in February but with the addition of commerce providers, which allows real &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; money for use within the system. We now feature the following commerce providers for purchasing Flares, starbeam.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Hello out there and welcome to your monthly starbeam.one update, which occurs on the first Tuesday of every month.
Things Are Better Now Last month featured all sorts of problems, which I am glad to say most if not all have been resolved. Rather than a raging inferno, the landscape is more of a (manageable üòÅ) smoldering mess. I have attended to most of the pressing concerns and have moved onto building features again.</description>

      <description>Why hello there! It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month, which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for your next installment of starbeam.one monthly status updates.
Everything is on Fire&amp;hellip; Sometimes the expression &amp;ldquo;on fire&amp;rdquo; can be a good thing. Most of the times it is not. Currently, the state of this project is in the latter, unfortunately. Every day seems like a new challenge or something else breaking. I am currently attending to each one as the only person on this project at the moment and making due with the resources and limitations presented to me.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the next installment of monthly starbeam.one updates.
Playground Alpha Deployed to Azure In the last status update, I mentioned that my focus for January was getting the Playground Alpha deployed to Azure. I am pleased to announce that this was accomplished after much configuration and trial+error (and much more error!).
The Playground Alpha is deployed to Azure, and I have been totally blown away by how relatively easy it was to do so, despite all the challenges and errors.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s get on with the latest update here&amp;hellip;
Playground Alpha Feature Complete To start, I am pleased to announce that the playground alpha is feature complete and ready for deployment.
What that means is that the Playground Alpha, slated for availability next month, will allow you to use all the features of starbeam.</description>

      <description>Greetings and Happy Holidays. Here is your next installment of starbeam.one monthly updates.
I feel the need to say this each time, but yes, I am still alive. üòä I am also a bit late this time around, having skipped the November update. Originally, I was aiming for the middle of November, but the final feature task that I was working on took way longer than I anticipated&amp;hellip; again. üòÖüò≠</description>

      <description>Goodness, has it been two months already? I have been in a total coding slog since the last checkin, having to battle two coding fronts that address technical debt concerns:
 Identity System (95% complete) Entity Framework Data Access Refactor (65% complete)  The Entity Framework story is a bit further along than it suggests. Part of the issue is that currently all worker processes run in session scope, which makes sense.</description>

      <description>Well I am still kicking and coding here. I wanted to take a breath here and check in with progress. Not that there is much of any. üòÖüò≠
While I have been plugging some insane hours lately, I have recently been ambushed by the identity system. It was basically like writing a whole new application. What I have built, however, is pretty neat and I am happy with it. Unfortunately, it has pushed my schedule out further, however, so I am trying to deal with the anxiety that goes along with it.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s July, and as mentioned last time, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a break. Except&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take a break. üòÖüò≠ I think I mentioned that I am working on the identity system. Indeed, I have taken a wrecking ball to this sucker and it is now officially wrecked. I&amp;rsquo;ve been picking up the pieces and putting them back together, but it&amp;rsquo;s been taking WAY longer than expected.</description>

      <description>Well, alright. After all the commotion of last month, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding it quite difficult to settle down and get back into the development groove.
What I find interesting is that my life is quite perfect right now for development (ala no emails, etc.), and even then it takes several days if not a full week to get me back in the zone for the 10-12 hour day slog.
Naturally, such a long time-to-focus process gives me a lot of concern for when things get &amp;ldquo;busy&amp;rdquo; (ala the email train) again.</description>

      <description>Goodness, what a run. I have basically been on a development tear since the last check-in, clocking about 10-12 hours a day. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s my typical schedule, but all of it has been totally dedicated to disciplined development, which is the ideal.
So upon last check-in I believe I was spilling about having some videos done by now, which WAS ALL A LIE. üòÖ Shows you for taking the time to believe me.</description>

      <description>Aw jyea&amp;hellip; I am finding myself with the time to write a status update, so that must mean I am in another creative jam. üòÜ
Well it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad, but I thought I would take a few seconds to chime in here. Things are going pretty well. I am down to one last feature item, which should take about two weeks (ü§û). Then after that, it&amp;rsquo;s off to the races with completing deferred tasks.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year&amp;hellip; ish. üòÅ I am having a little down time &amp;ndash; a case of the January&amp;rsquo;s as it were &amp;ndash; so I decided to check in here with a little update.
Things are actually running at a pretty good clip here. In fact, I hesitate to mention it but I am in a bit of a groove as of late, pretty much writing solutions and supporting code at will.</description>
